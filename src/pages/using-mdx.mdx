## Working with MDX

Welcome to a page written with MDX.

### Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

You can read more about it [here](https://mdxjs.com/).

Here is a code block:

```js
import styled from "styled-components"

const FlexBox = styled.div`
  display: flex;
`
```

To learn more, head over to Gatsby's [documentation about MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/).
